This comes up in Java 5 and later if you're using collections without type specifiers (e.g., Arraylist() instead of ArrayList<String>()). It means that the compiler can't check that you're using the collection in a type-safe way, using generics.

To get rid of the warning, just be specific about what type of objects you're storing in the collection. So, instead of

List myList = new ArrayList();
use

List<String> myList = new ArrayList<String>();
